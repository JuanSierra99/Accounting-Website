<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This repository is dedicated to a full-stack web application that exemplifies my proficiency in building robust and scalable applications using Node.js, React, and TypeScript. The project focuses on a simple yet effective accounting platform that allows users to efficiently manage invoices and bills.

The primary goal of this project was to demonstrate a well-rounded skill set in full-stack development, encompassing both backend and frontend domains. The backend is engineered using Node.js with NestJS, integrating Prisma ORM for sophisticated data handling. The frontend, developed with React and enriched by TypeScript's type safety, offers a seamless user experience for interacting with financial records.

Here's why:

- Backend API Development: Crafted with Node.js and NestJS, the backend features essential routes for invoices and bills management, fortified with user authentication to safeguard access and ensure data privacy.
- Database Integration: Leverages Prisma ORM for an efficient and flexible approach to data management, supporting a variety of databases (SQLite, MongoDB, PostgreSQL) to suit the project's needs for durable data storage.
- Frontend Application: The React-based frontend, utilizing TypeScript, provides an intuitive interface for users to manage financial documents. Key features include listing invoices and bills, detailed modals for item inspection, and secure API interactions for data retrieval.

The development of this project was guided by principles of simplicity and functionality. The aim was to create a platform that not only showcases my capabilities in developing both backend and frontend components but also emphasizes clean, modular code and effective state management. Through this project, I sought to highlight my comprehensive understanding of application development, from database schema design to user interface creation and API security.
